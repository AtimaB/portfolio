### Portfolio

  The portfolio page has all the photo I took. The first one is "Do Good Distillery". Before I moved to Utah, my husband and I worked at this distillery.Its his family's bussiness. I was the photographer, graphic designer and a marketing. I helped design the website and design all , magazine, brochure, business cards and anything about marketing merchandices. I had fun working in this possition but unfortunely one of our family member passed away (He was our head distiller)  and we decided we had no longer wanted to continue making whsikey so we sold the distillery and moved to utah.
